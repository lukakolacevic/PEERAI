# PEERAI — AI-Driven Peer Moderation Platform

PEERAI is a hackathon-built platform designed to enhance community safety by enabling peer-based moderation using AI-assisted tools. It empowers system admins to **review**, **flag**, and **investigate** inappropriate interactions or user behavior in digital selling communities like Njuškalo and Vinted.

Built during a fast-paced sprint, this app combines a sleek interface with essential moderation workflows, all backed by modern frontend technology.
